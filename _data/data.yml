    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
       I started my journey in the IT world with 'dual studies' (apprenticeship and studies combined) at Siemens AG. 
       After completion and a few years of application management for Microsoft SharePoint and Project Server at PSoD (Project Service on Demand) I took on a new challenge at AvePoint (ISV and Microsoft Partner) and started my career in the PreSales field. 
       
       I really enjoy doing PreSales - the combination of IT and problem solving, talking with people about business challenges is a very good combination for me as I am open minded and always (almost) positive. 
       
       With Okta I continued my journey in PreSales - connecting the right people to the right technology at the right time. I am working with all segments, recently more focused on Enterprise and Strategic accounts in the Central & Eastern Europe region. I received plenty of great feedback from prospects and customers for my unique way of doing things (e. g. Whiteboarding, approaching prospects) - backed by awards (read below).
       
       During the last years I began to mentor new hires and helped them onboard to their new role at Okta. I also took over opportunities such as the first PreSales Academy in EMEA (people switching careers or their first job - 6 months onboarding program). I found this very rewarding to help and see people grow - that is what sparked my eandeavor to grow into leadership. Ulimately achieving the "Tech Win" is our main goal in Solutions Engineering - during my time in Leadership I drove a few projects in regards to tracking progress in Opportunities (Salesforce) and also on how to track time, activities and engagements in an easy way.

       I am a member in the Munich PreSales Group as well since some years of PreSales Collective.

      I like to tinker around with Hard- and Software. I always had a liking for NAS (NSLU2), embedded systems and ThinClients and use these in areas for which they were not designed. Also always open to try new things such as setting up a MIM proxy (evilginx). I am into homelabbing (Proxmox) and running plenty of virtualizied and containerized services for a bunch of self-hosted services. 
      Enjoying to go to meetups (meetup.com) to get to know new people and learn new technology and just connect.
